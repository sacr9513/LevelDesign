In this level I wanted to get some interesting mechanics (the moving platform) working with some of the other enemies. I thought it would be interesting to also force the player to choose between getting items and facing enemies, particularly without a weapon. I created a wall so you know which way to start moving (to the right) and a fake passage downwards the leads to spikes to encourage exploration.
